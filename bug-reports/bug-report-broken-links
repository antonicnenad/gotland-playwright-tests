# 🐞 Bug Report – Broken Links in the Information Section

**🔗 Affected URL:**  
[https://www.destinationgotland.se/en/Booking-terms/](https://www.destinationgotland.se/en/Booking-terms/)

**📍 Location on Page:**  
At the bottom of the Accommodation page in the **Information** section (side menu), under links:

- **Booking Terms**
- **Questions & Answers**

**🧭 Steps to Reproduce:**

1. Scroll down to the “Information” section.
2. Click on the **Booking terms** link.
3. Observe that:
   - The user is redirected to a broken URL.
   - A `404 Page Not Found` message appears.
   - The language automatically switches to Swedish.

🔁 Same behavior occurs when clicking **Questions & answers**.

---

**❌ Actual Result:**  
User lands on a 404 page (`Sidan saknas`) in **Swedish**, which is confusing for English-speaking users.

**✅ Expected Result:**  
The user should be redirected to a valid English version of the selected resource (e.g., booking terms or FAQ).

**💡 Suggested Fix:**  
Ensure that:

- URLs for the "Booking Terms" and "Questions & Answers" point to valid, English-localized pages.
- The language does **not** switch unexpectedly from English to Swedish.
